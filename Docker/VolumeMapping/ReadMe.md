- create a folder and have all the following files in it- docker-compose.yml, DockerFile, index.html, nginx.conf, ReadMe.md, runner.sh
- build the DockerFile to create an image : sudo docker build -t myngnix .
 
 here "mynginx" is the name and -t is used to give any name to image and . says that the Dockerfile is present in the same folder. make sure that the file name is "DockerFile"
